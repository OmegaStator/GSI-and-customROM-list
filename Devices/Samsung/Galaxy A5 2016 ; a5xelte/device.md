# Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018) / a7y18lte

## GSI Ranking : Not compatible ðŸš©
This device got this ranking because it doesn't support project Treble, and so doesn't support GSIs

## Warnings
- Seems like some firmware-givers lets you download a glitched firmware that tricks your device to be in ARMV8l, which is a 32-bit mode on a 64-bit processor, check your processor arch if you reflash your stock firmware. The problem also seems to happen on custom ROMs after installing theses bugged firmwares, it might be caused by a glitched Bootloader

## General information
- Device architecture : ARM64

## Tips and tricks
If you are on stock firmware, try to keep it. If you don't,trying to reflash the firmware could create glitches like said in ___warning___
