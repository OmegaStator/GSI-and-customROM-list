Here are the instructions of how to contribute

### Adding a GSI/Custom ROM
To add a GSI, simply create a .md file into /GSI/[[your GSI android version + codename + SDK version]]

To add a Custom ROM, create a .md file into /Devices/[[device brand]]/[device name + codename]/[[Android version of the rom]]/

Please remember that your .md file needs to have the complete name of your GSI (ex: LineageOS18.1)

You can add your GSI to the mainlist.md But don't worry if you don't do it, we will do it for you.

For adding a Custom ROM, you can add it to the device.md file but we can also do it for you

For making your .md file, you can follow the template at /Contributors/GSI_create.md

If the android version doesn't exitst __you can create it__

__Every information marked in GSI_create is needed. If something is missing, we might deny your demand__

### Adding a device

After this is done, follow the template in /Contributors/device_create.md
