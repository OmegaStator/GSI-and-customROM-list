# Know if your device works great with GSIs or Custom ROMs and get help on how to flash them

This list is intended to know if GSIs or CustomROMs works great with your device

## Device GSI Ranking

### Not compatible üö©
Talks by itself, theses devices can't install GSIs and no ROMs make it compatible (at least of what we know)

### Absolute Garbage üçÖ
Devices with this ranking needs a custom ROM to make GSIs works or major features are missing or have major issues.

### Not really good üëé
Devices with this ranking are known for having big issues with almost every GSI.

### Meh üòë
Devices with this ranking don't have major issues, but have smaller issues (like multi camera issues) or don't work great in a lot of GSIs.

Devices with uncommon GSI architectures (like A-only type or ARM64-Binder) are more likely to get this ranking

### Pretty good ü§ó
A device with this ranking works great without any important issue and great compatibility with other GSIs

### Goated üî•
Devices that have this rank have really great performance and no issues whatsoever. If you have one of these devices, you should try installing a GSI.

### Uncategorized ü§î
These devices didn't have enough tests to be sure about what works and what doesn't.
